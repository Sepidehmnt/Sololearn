          <p>
            Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the
            internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website
            development rather than software development. Web design used to be
            focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the
            mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become
            ever-increasingly important.

          <p>
            Design is simple, yet it's so ubiquitous that it's hard to pin down in
            one easy definition. Technically, graphic design is the communication of
            an idea using visual means. Graphic designers use various tools to
            achieve the goal, including elements like typography, colors, shapes, and
            illustrations.

            <p>
              Email marketing is one element of a marketing strategy. It involves the
              use of emails to keep customers informed about company news, limited
              time offers, product updates, and more. When done effectively, email is
              a powerful communication tool that can build relationships with
              potential customers and increase your sales efforts.
